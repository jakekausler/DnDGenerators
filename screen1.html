                        <h1>Chase</h1>
                        <p>During the chase, participants can freely use the DASH action a number of times equal to 3 + its CON modifier.</p>
                        <p>Each additional DASH requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 CON check at the end of its turn or take one level of Exhaustion.</p>
                        <p>Stopping to cast spells will allow the pursued to increase their lead, and may well mean they will get away, but it is certainly not forbidden.</p>
                        <h2>Ending the Chase</h2>
                        <p>Each quarry makes a DEX (Stealth) check at the end of each round, after everyone has had their turn. The result is compared to the Passive PER score of the pursuer(s).</p>
                        <p>If the quarry is NEVER out of the pursuerâ€™s sight, the check fails automatically.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise, if the Stealth check is higher than the PER score, the quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues.</p>
                        <h2>Escape Factors</h2>
                        <table>

                        <h2>Chase Complications</h2>
                        <p>As with any good chase scene, complications can arise to make a chase more pulse-pounding.</p>
                        <p>Complications occur randomly. Each participant in the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the appropriate table to determine whether a complication occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend inspiration to negate the complication.</p>

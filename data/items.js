His lute design, later copied by some of his admirers, was a simple oak lute, reinforced with an iron shell, to maintain the soft vibration of the sound against the wooden interior, and to give the lute the strength to crack open an orc's skull with a well placed blow. This weapon functions both as a lute and a weapon. When used as a lute, it is considered to be a lute and does not require a separate proficiency bonus to play. However, if the user rolls a critical miss with the weapon (a 1 on an attack roll) the lute may become slightly damaged and will require the user to spend an hour to retune it. If the instrument is not returned, whenever the instrument is played, the user is disadvantaged on the Perform check. This weapon can also be used as a bard's spellcasting focus. ",

As a ritual, you can expend one tooth to gain its property for 24 hours or until a new ritual has been performed. Constructs, Oozes, and Plants are unaffected by this item. Undead whose essence you sap grant you a tooth with the type that it possessed in life rather than undeath.  *Aberrations: You can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 ft. that can understand a Language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.  *Beasts: Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level.  *Celestials: As an action, you can touch a target and remove any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness condition.  *Dragons: Your breath weapon gains a recharge of 6 and its damage die is increased to d8.  *Elemental: You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder and gain resistance to that element.  *Fey: Touching a creature, you magically know the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you also know the creature's alignment. Celestials, Fiends, and Undead automatically fail the saving throw.  *Fiends: You gain advantage on saving throws against Spells and other magical effects.  *Giants: Your Strength score is 21. This property has no effect on you if your Strength is already 21 or higher without this necklace.  *Humanoids: You become proficient in any two skills. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.  *Monstrosities: You gain Darkvision 60 Ft. and Tremorsense 60 Ft.

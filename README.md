# DnDGenerators

This project still has a lot of work to go, especially in code clean-up and transferring out json to individual files. It has rudimentary support for building random encounters (both general and monster) based on terrain and party level, encounter loot with a bigger variety of mundane and magical items (though magical items are still rare), fully fleshed-out NPC generation, random shop inventory selectors for differing levels of remoteness and shop types, and a weather generator that takes into account the previous weather and the climate.
